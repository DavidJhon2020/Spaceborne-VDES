# Spaceborne-VDES
Using MATLAB, the algorithms that solve noise and slot transformations for existing VDES are reproduced and optimized. It mainly focuses on reading relevant papers, learning a variety of algorithms, using MATLAB to reproduce, and finally comparing the performance of algorithms to obtain a complete research report.
